Now we are creating test cases for the design to check the design.
Test case: Creating a scenario(inputs) to test one feature of design is called test-case.
-----------
Test plan: |
-----------
    - The test case that works for one feature of the design may not work for other feature of the same design.
    - So, we write different test cases based on the feature of the design.
    - Merging all those test cases of the design in one spreadsheet is what we called "TEST PLAN".
    - we give test case name(string) as command line argument, based on that, TB will generate the scenarion and send it to design.
    - TB will access user argument using "$value$plusargs".

CREATING FOUR TESTCASES:
    1-Front door write, Front door read(FD write FD read) - test_fd_write_fd_read
    2-BD write FD read- test_fd_write_bd_read
    3-BD write BD read- test_bd_write_fd_read
    4-FD write BD read- test_bd_write_bd_read
    5-random write and reads- test_random_write_read
