Verilog :
  - To avoid signal driving and sampling exactly at the positive ede of clokc, we introduce small delay before and after the edge of the clock.

System Verilog: 
	- SV provides 'clocking block' to do this automatically, with minimal updates ==> Thi is better way of doing than Verilog.
	- Modport and clocking block are inter-linked.
		- when clocking block is there, modport should be there and vice-versa.
- CLOCKING BLOCK should be kept in interface class.


CLOCKING BLOCK:
---------------
- Used to avoid signal driving and sampling issues.
- Driving 
    - driving addr = 100
    - Design inputs are driven by BFM.
    - We don't want to drive exactly at +edge of the clock.
        - It leads to race condition, where signal may be captured or may not captured.
        - Setup time: How much time before +edge of clock, input must be stable, so thet design can capture it properly.
        
    - Sampling:
      - Sample rdata of 200 value.
      - Design output are sampled by BFM.
    
    
    - Drive design inputs just after the positive edge of clock, so that, they will be captured at the next positive edge of clock.
        - Just ater? what is the value of just after.
            - just after ==> output skew ==> #1
            
    - Sample design outputs just before the positive edge of clock, so that, we give enough time for deign to process the inputs and provide us with stable output value.
        - Just before? what is the value of just before.
            - Just before ==> input skew ==> #1
