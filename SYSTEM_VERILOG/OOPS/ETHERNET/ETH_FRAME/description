Local Area Network(LAN) communication frame: 
	- Intra-Network Communication: Ethernet frame
	-Ethernet is the wired technology that allows devices to send and receive data in a fast, organized, and reliable way.

network to network communication --> IPv4 and IPv6 communication.

802.3 Ethernet frame structure:
================================
preamble : series of zeros and ones --> 7 octets (56 bits) --> 28 ones and 28 zeros.
	1 octet = 8 bits.
	- It tells the receiver that some transaction is going to start.
	Purpose: Helps the receiver sync up and prepare for incoming data.
	
start of frame delimiter(sfd):
	Tells the receiver: “The real data starts now, right after this.”
	- It's 10101011, right after the preamble.

Destination Address (6 octets).
- 🏠 “Deliver this to my friend.”
- The MAC address of the device you're sending the frame to.
- Like writing your friend's house address on a package.

Source Address (6 octets).
- 🏡 “I’m the one who sent this.”
- The MAC address of the device that’s sending the frame.
- Like writing your own address on the box — “From: Me.”

length : it should be inside 42 to 1500 octets. So, we will write a constraint for that.
	constraint length_C { //length should be between 42 to 1500 octets.
		len inside {[42:1500]};
	}
	
payload: payload size should be length number of octets.
	constraint payload_C {
		payload.size() == len;
	}
	
crc: cyclic redundancy check
